# Gaja
[WIP] A climate accounting tool using Decentr and Holochain

[Gaja](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaja) is a Sanskrit word for elephant. It is a double entendre, because 
[the elephant in the room](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant_in_the_room) has been climate change, and because this tool, using [Decentr](https://decentr.net/), can offer an opportunity for attributes that a gaja personifies: including abundance and richness; boldness and strength. Decentr can offer undreamt-of possibilities for economic growth and prosperity, societal flourishing, and environmental regeneration and rejuvenation. Decentr is planned to be built on [Holochain](https://holochain.org/), while leveraging its unique economic model involving using data as payable and tradable value.
