// Pseudo-pseudo-code

// get greenhouse gas emissions now
// e.g. https://www.co2.earth/daily-co2
// 419.85 ppm May 17, 2021 (fetch this daily figure from oracle / API)
// current_CO2
// set constant greenhouse gas target, say 280 ppm
// calculate the difference
// get global carbon budget in GtCO2-e
// "To convert from ppm to gigatonne of carbon, the conversion tables of the Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center
// advise that 1 part per million of atmospheric CO2 is equivalent to 2.13 Gigatonnes Carbon.
// Using our 44 over 12 rule, this means 1ppm = 7.8 Gigatonnes of Carbon Dioxide in the atmosphere."
https://skepticalscience.com/print.php?r=45
// Assuming that this figure is accurate
// 419.85 - 350 = 69.85 ppm
* 7.8 = 544.83 GtCO2

Need to account for CO2-e, not just CO2

E.g.:
"The annual average CO2-e measured at Cape Grim reached 503 ppm in 2019, which is almost twice the pre-industrial level of 278 ppm in 1750"
http://www.bom.gov.au/state-of-the-climate/greenhouse-gas-levels.shtml

503-278 = 325 ppm

= > 1755 GtCO2 needed to reduce

// Calculate GAPT rewards
// Price fluctuates in line with how much is needed to reduce
// higher difference, higher price
// 1,000,000 tokens current supply

Reward for removing 1 tCO2-e:

e6 tokens / 1755e9 kgC02

5.6980057e-7 token / tCO2

Or 5.6980057e-10 token / kgCO2

Note-> interchange tokens with mutual credit (they will be 1:1 interchangeable up to 12 months from main net release)
// code should use credit limits and credit, not tokens

Price of tokens are not set inside the protocol at this point.

// loop every period (e.g. a year):
// while difference is positive
// reward emissions reduction and avoidance
// stage 1: rewards are constant
// stage 2: mint tokens as the difference increase, and as the difference decreases.
// otherwise if the difference is negative (which won't happen any time soon!), rewards = 0

// emissions reward mechanisms for different agent types
// agentType - > solar system

// connect to a solar system
// measure its generation in real-time

// other emission-reduction-equivalencies are also in this page above
// for each (10, 100, or 1000) kWh produced (depending on network fees), increase credit limit
